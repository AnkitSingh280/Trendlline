Hi everyone,
I just created a website called Trendlline ðŸ‘‰ https://trendlline.netlify.app/

This project was built using HTML & CSS only and was mainly focused on:

Practicing layout and styling

Experimenting with different sections like Studio, Collections, Journal

Improving my fundamentals in frontend development

Itâ€™s still not responsive yet, but Iâ€™m excited to work on adding responsiveness and interactivity (using JavaScript) in future updates.

This small step keeps me motivated to learn and get better every day. Would love to hear feedback! ðŸ’¡
